# Redux Guards Example Project

This is a simple app with a normal and async counter. The async version uses [redux-pack](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/redux-pack).

If you would like to see more types of middleware or anything else, open an issue and request one, or issue a PR!

# Kick the tires

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

VSCode should work as you would expect with the latest version of TypeScript.
